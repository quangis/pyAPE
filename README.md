pyAPE
===============================================================================

`pyAPE` is a Pythonic interface to [APE](https://github.com/sanctuuary/APE), 
the Automated Pipeline Explorer for workflow synthesis. Features will be added 
on an as-needed basis, but pull requests are welcome.

    pip install pyAPE

It is based on version 1.1.5 of APE; the appropriate 
[jar](https://github.com/sanctuuary/APE/releases/download/v1.1.5/APE-1.1.5-executable.jar) 
file will be downloaded on first run.
